This project is for learning purposes.

Its purpose is to build a web app where you can upload your PDFs chat with AI about your files, and ask for suggestions, changes, or explanations.

It is a Next.js SaaS project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`]. It is written with Typescript, I am using tRPC to ensure type safety throughout the API communication.

To simplify database management, I am utilising Prisma.

To style, I am using Tailwind and also shadcn-ui library.

The authentication process is powered by Kinde.

Please be aware that this project is still in built, and also in collaboration with another Dev (@Halil-Coskun).
